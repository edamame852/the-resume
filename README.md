# Next.js i18n Starter for Static Pages

Clients will directly redirected from `/` to `/[lang]` based on the detected language.

Packages included:

- [i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next)
- [i18next-browser-languagedetector](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-browser-languageDetector)

- Set the supported languages, default language, namespaces and default namespace in `/src/i18n/config.js`
